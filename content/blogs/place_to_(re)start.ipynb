Not only because of my local reality (Brazil), but even the overall worldwide stats shows the same picture: you decide to bet on the academia and the most probable outcome is that you won't be able to just pursuit science for your whole carreers. Simply put there are not enough chairs for everybody. And we all know that, we are aware of it, but hope is a sticky thing, you simple cannot let go of it...\n",
